# fleetify-frontend
Fleetify is a React-based web app for managing company and driver records. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and supports role-based access (RBAC). Admin users can add, edit, and view data, while other roles have read-only access. JWT is used for authentication, and the app communicates with backend REST APIs.
